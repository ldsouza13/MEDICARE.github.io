# MEDICARE - Drug Recommender System

**Objective:**


-The objective of this project is to develop a drug recommendation system for medical practitioners to get information on the popular drugs in the market at any point of time.

**Functionality and Usage:**

-The main functionality of this tool is to recommend drugs available in the market to doctors based on a recommended rating score provided by patient’s reviews and medical conditions.<br/>
-We intend to create this tool to help doctors get an idea about different drugs, with respect to the condition, based on reviews and ratings given by the patients. This would help them to shortlist the best drugs for each ailment and prescribe them accordingly.<br/> 
-This tool potentially eliminates the role of an intermediate medical representative from different pharmaceutical companies for briefing and awareness about the available drugs in the market.

**Dataset:**

 **Methodology:**
 
 **Text Preprocessing** 
 
    Text Pre-Processing using Snowball Stemmer:
        
        1.    Delete HTML 
        2.    Removing special characters and keeping only letters
        3.    Convert to lower-case
        4.    Removing Stop words
        5.    Stemming
        6.    Joining stemming words

    Text Pre-Processing using Spacy Tokenizer:
  
        1.    Creating the token object, which is used to create documents with linguistic annotations
        2.    Lemmatizing each token and converting each token into lowercase
        3.    Removing stop words   
        4.    Return preprocessed list of tokens
        
  **Sentiment Analysis:**
  
   - Vader Sentiment Analysis was performed on the preprocessed reviews.<br/>
   - Categorizes reviews into Positive(>=0.05), Neutral(between -0.05& 0.05) and Negative(<=-0.05)​
      
  **Machine Learning Models used for verifying score:**
  
  - 3 Machine Learning models were used :
  
   * Logistic Regression
   * SGD
   * Multinomial Naive Bayes
   
   - Logistic Regression had the maximum accuracy.
   
  **Normalization and recommended mean score:**
  
   1. Normalized the review rating to match the 0-10 rating scale
   2. Final drug rating was calculated as mean of the rating and normalized vader review score.
   3. Sorted the data based on Condition and Drug name and aggregate was taken for the normalized rating. 
   4. Recommendation was done by ranking the sorted data.
      
  **Dashboard Creation:**
  
        1.    Used Tableau Desktop/Public for Dashboard Creation
        2.    Embedded the Dashboard into a static website
        3.    Hosted the website on GitHub
        
        
  **Accomplishments**
  
This MEDICARE application developed based on a normalized recommended score, will help the doctors to view the top rated drugs for a    particular condition/disease by using a user-friendly and interactive web application. 

  **Future Scope**
  
-Although we tried removing spam reviews while preprocessing the data, the dataset had too many duplicate reviews. A proper spam removal model could be developed for the same in the future.<br/>
-Recommendation system using collaborative item-item based filtering
